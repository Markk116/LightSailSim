# LightSailSim: Lightsail Design and Simulation Tool
![nicegif](images/SchmancyGauss.gif)
This repository features a set of tools for analysing the deformation of membranes using a particle system model.  

## Installation

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/markk116/LightSailSim.git
cd LightSailSim
pip install -e .
```
Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd LightSailSim
```

To verify everything works you can run
```bash
python Simulations\Gao_et_al.py
```
from the root directory. 

## Usage 
### Running simulations
Navigate to the Simulations directory and run the desired script:
```bash
cd Simulations
python Simple_config_round.py
```

To get started you can follow the tutorials. Tutorial 1 is a basic overview of the Particle System Model. Tutorial 2 demonstrates the setup of a Lightsail Simulation. Tutorial 3 is yet to be made, but will explain how to add new photonic crystals to LSS.
